<h1> My projects: </h1>

<ul>

  <li> <a href="http://github.com/stefano/primitivearc"> primitivearc </a> was born as a compiler for a really small subset of Arc targeting the <a href="http://www.parrot.org"> Parrot </a> VM. The original idea was to use that subset to develop a full blown Arc for Parrot, but now the goal of primitivearc is to <em> be </em> a full Arc implementation. In the future, it will also go beyond the language standard. </li>

  <li> <a href="http://github.com/stefano/nyac"> Nyac </a> is a metacircular x86 compiler for a subset of Arc. It runs only under GNU/Linux, 32 bits. </li>

  <li> <a href="http://stefano.github.com/logoweb"> LogoWeb </a> is a simple turtle graphics program, written mainly to learn JavaScript and the &lt;canvas&gt; tag. </li>

</ul>
